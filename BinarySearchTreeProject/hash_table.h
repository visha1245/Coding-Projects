 * hash_table.h

 * Modified: 04/10/2024
 * 
 * This class represents a templated hash table that uses a linked list for chaining.
 * It is assumed that data items contain the method get_key, which returns a string.
 * Some methods have const removed to make things easier for us!
 * This file should be used in conjunction with Assignment 3 for SENG1120.
